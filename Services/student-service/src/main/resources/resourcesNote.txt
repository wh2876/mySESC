Originally I just copied all the static/template files from the finance service since they weren't created for me (likely due to the relevant dependency missing when using sprint initializr)
I also copied the code from a GeeksForGeeks site for tabs in html, but didnt use any of the tab stuff in the end (replaced it with usage of the navbar, copied from finance service), but forgot to remove the <header> stuff. I am avoiding removing it to prevent accidentally creating any problems while I am finishing up the assignment

When I added comments to the html files, some of them caused runtime problems, so I'm putting a brief breakdown of each of them here

__header.html__
same as from finance service, changed author content from tvergilio to williamHart just now, didn't test, hopefully hasn't broken anything

__nav.html__
largely the same, just added two extra nav elements and changed colour of some text

__courses.html__
uses courseList, student, and financeConnected model attributes
displays courses in a list, with an enroll/disenroll button that changes depending on current signedIn/Enrollment status, or just says unavailable if finance service is innaccessible
redirects user to account page if they try to enroll while not signed in

__editStudent.html__
uses updatedStudent modelAttribute
has 2 boxes for forename and surname changes,. displays error msgs if invalid entries are submitted
allows user to cancel which goes back regular account page

__error.html__
copied exactly from finance service, no real need to change

__portal.html__
just has a short explanation of what the user can do
should have links to finance and library portal I think, but its not like the user can make use of those unless they are signed in anyway

__student.html__
uses student, signIn, register, and financeConnected modelAttributes
displays sign in / register boxes+buttons if not signed in

if signed in
displays student info, courses enrolled in, graduation eligibility, invoices, and edit account+log out buttons
once signed in the user can enroll/disenroll from courses
